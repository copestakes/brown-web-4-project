      <h1>About Us</h1>
      Once a horse is rescued, we provide medical care, rehabilitation and schooling and then adopt many of them into
  
      loving, forever homes. Our rescue also provides a permanent sanctuary to elderly and disabled horses that have
  
      been callously discarded because they are “too old,” “too sick,” or unwanted.

    <p>We receive no funding from the state or federal agencies . we rely soley on YOUR donations for support.Your financial support provides the food, supplements and care each horse here needs to stay healthy in their golden years, and most if our seniors live well into their thirties because of the care that you help provide.</p>

    <p class="box-2-text">
      Making a donation will allow us to continue to do what we do best…save horses that are suffering, abused, and neglected and provide long-term care to the very senior permanent residents that call BFF home. The horses we rescued from the hanging barn in 2016 were with us just five months. Because of their dire condition, it cost over $18,000 to make them healthy again. Medical expenses for the six horses from the hanging barn alone were over $10,000 and funds raised for their care totaled $8,500…well short of what was needed.
