    <h1>About Us</h1>
    Once a horse is rescued, we provide medical care, rehabilitation and schooling and then adopt many of them into

    loving, forever homes. Our rescue also provides a permanent sanctuary to elderly and disabled horses that have

    been callously discarded because they are “too old,” “too sick,” or unwanted.

  <h1>HELP US DO WHAT WE DO BEST

    AND GIVE THE GIFT OF LIFE</h1>

  <p class="box-2-text">
    Making a donation will allow us to continue to do what we do best…save horses that are suffering, abused, and neglected and provide long-term care to the very senior permanent residents that call BFF home. The horses we rescued from the hanging barn in 2016 were with us just five months. Because of their dire condition, it cost over $18,000 to make them healthy again. Medical expenses for the six horses from the hanging barn alone were over $10,000 and funds raised for their care totaled $8,500…well short of what was needed.

      <p class="box-2-text">

    Better yet, would you like to become a monthly sponsor of one of our seniors? The DONATE button below will allow you to make a one-time donation of any amount, or sign up to be a monthly sponsor. And, please check with your employer to see if they will match your donation and DOUBLE your support. Many do.
